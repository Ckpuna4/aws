### Who are we?
**The Rolling Scopes** is an independent international community of developers (mainly JavaScript, Front-end, AWS, iOS, Android, etc.).

**RS School** is a free-of-charge and community-based education program run by the Rolling Scopes developer community since 2013.
Thousands of graduated trainees in 11 countries and 500+ mentors around the world.

**RS AWS Club** - part of The Rolling Scopes focused on NodeJS and AWS technologies. We meet regularly to share ideas, answer questions, and learn about new services and best practices.

### What are our principles?
- **Open to everyone.** Free courses, no obligations, and no contracts. No age limit. Only studentsâ€™ time and dedication are required. Students can repeatedly attend courses.
- **Open source philosophy.** [Our Learning Management System](https://github.com/rolling-scopes/rsschool-app) platform and education materials are publicly available on GitHub and YouTube.
- **Teach it forward** According to this principle, students study at school for free, but we request that they return as mentors to pass on their knowledge to the next generation of students.
